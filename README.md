# stock-technical-analysis

Examining a strategy is so important for investors, but it seems not so easy. I used to make it with quantopian and zipline, they so great, but using them in china is so complicated. And i want to put some deep learning technology on stock analyzing and decision making. Here u can modify line 103 to change the condition of choose an action with different moving average lines. With some modification (line 95 to 103) u can put kdj or macd data. 

more details will be added soon ...
